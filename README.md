# Portfolio

## Description

This website showcases some of the projects I have completed while taking part in a Front-End Web Development Bootcamp and was built using skills I have learnt in the first couple of weeks, namely: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

The site should meet the following criteria:
    * When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
    * When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    * When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
    * When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    * When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
    * When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

The deployed application can be found at https://rishibajaj.github.io/dummy_portfolio

## Usage

A website to showcase the projects I have developed to potential employers. The work section has five cards displayed in a grid, which can link to completed projects. This grid, as well as the rest of the site, is responsive to screen size

Here is a screenshot of the deployed application:
